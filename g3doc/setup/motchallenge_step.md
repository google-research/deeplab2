# Run DeepLab2 on MOTChallenge-STEP dataset

## MOTChallenge-STEP dataset

MOTChallenge-STEP extends the existing [MOTChallenge](https://motchallenge.net/)
dataset with spatially and temporally dense annotations.

### Label Map

MOTChallenge-STEP dataset followings the same annotation and label policy as
[KITTI-STEP dataset](./kitti_step.md). Among the
[MOTChallenge](https://motchallenge.net/) dataset, 4 outdoor sequences are
annotated for MOTChallenge-STEP. In particular, these sequences are splitted
into 2 for training and 2 for testing. This dataset contains only 7 semantic
classes, as not all of
[Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/#class-definitions)'
19 semantic classes are present.

Label Name     | Label ID
-------------- | --------
sidewalk       | 0
building       | 1
vegetation     | 2
sky            | 3
person&dagger; | 4
rider          | 5
bicycle        | 6
void           | 255

&dagger;: Single instance annotations are available.

### Prepare MOTChallenge-STEP for Training and Evaluation

In the following, we provide a step-by-step walk through to prepare the data.

1.  Create the MOTChallenge-STEP directory: 

    ```bash
    mkdir ${MOTCHALLENGE_STEP_ROOT}/images
    cd ${MOTCHALLENGE_STEP_ROOT}/images
    ```

2.  Download MOTChallenge images from https://motchallenge.net/data/MOTS.zip and
    unzip.

    ```bash
    wget ${MOTCHALLENGE_LINK} 
    unzip ${MOTCHALLENGE_IMAGES}.zip
    ```

3.  Move and rename the data:

    ```bash
    # Create directories.
    mkdir train
    mkdir train/0002
    mkdir train/0009
    mkdir test
    mkdir test/0001
    mkdir test/0007

    # Copy data.
    cp -r MOTS/train/MOTS20-02/img1/* train/0002/
    cp -r MOTS/train/MOTS20-09/img1/* train/0009/
    cp -r MOTS/test/MOTS20-01/img1/* test/0001/
    cp -r MOTS/test/MOTS20-07/img1/* test/0007/

    # Clean up.
    rm -r MOTS
    ```

4.  Download groundtruth MOTChallenge-STEP panoptic maps from
    https://motchallenge.net/data/motchallenge-step.tar.gz

    ```bash
    cd ${MOTCHALLENGE_STEP_ROOT}
    wget ${MOTCHALLENGE_GT_LINK} 
    tar -xvf ${MOTCHALLENGE_GT}.zip
    ```

The groundtruth panoptic map is encoded in the same way as described in
[KITTI-STEP dataset](./kitti_step.md).

DeepLab2 requires the dataset to be converted to TFRecords for efficient reading
and prefetching. To create the dataset for training and evaluation, run the
following command:

```bash
python deeplab2/data/build_step_data.py \
  --step_root=${MOTCHALLENGE_STEP_ROOT} \
  --output_dir=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```

This script outputs three sharded tfrecord files: `{train|test}@10.tfrecord`. In
the tfrecords, for `train` set, it contains the RGB image pixels as well as
their panoptic maps. For `test` set, it contains RGB images only. These files
will be used as the input for the model training and evaluation.

Optionally, you can also specify with `--use_two_frames` to encode two
consecutive frames into the tfrecord files.
